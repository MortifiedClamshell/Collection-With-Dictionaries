# CollectionWithDictionaries

This project is a Tkinter-based application that demonstrates how to use dictionaries to manage collections of data. The application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with and manipulate the data stored in dictionaries.

## Project Description

The main features of the application include:
- Adding new items to the collection
- Removing items from the collection
- Updating existing items
- Displaying the entire collection

The project is designed to be a simple yet effective way to understand the use of dictionaries in Python and how they can be integrated into a graphical user interface using Tkinter.

## Use of AI and Other Resources

To complete this project, I utilized GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool, to assist with coding and provide suggestions. I also used Chat GBT to create a base list of books for the libary. I basicly used it to do everything and ran checks to make sure that it worked correctly.
